The topic of the whole speech revolves around my philosophy of life and the process of thinking and decision-making.
Especially after I chose to enter the field of economics,
I have the ability to express the questions that I have been thinking about
since I was in the seventh to ninth grades in a more rigorous way,
and I am also able to convey these academic language to the students sitting in the audience
through examples suitable for the audience (thanks to my teachers for their excellent guidance and teaching).</p><p>This is not the first time I have given a speech to junior high school students.
In fact, I have been invited many times to speak to high school students.
I am passionate about educational issues and passing on my ideas to others,
and I also believe that passing on high-level knowledge and thought processes to young students
enables them to think and explore their lives and the world from a young age.
Taiwanese education system does not give students enough time to think about life and explore the world;
on the contrary, schools require students to spend too much time learning rigid knowledge.
Under such an atmosphere and pressure,
students do not have many incentives to think about &ldquo;not-in-the-examination&rdquo; questions,
which I think is quite a pity and incorrect.
So every time I have the opportunity to talk to young students,
I hope that I can arouse their interest in thinking about higher-level issues,
instead of confining life to exams and schools.</p><p>Although the <a href=https://hackmd.io/@ujkuo/Bkt3NVkps>presentation slide</a> is in Chinese,
I believe that Google Translate can convey the ideas in the presentation excellently.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-chieh-kuo-94645b193/ class="fab fa-linkedin fa-1x" title=LinkedIn></a>
