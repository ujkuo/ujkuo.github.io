The attachments below are part of my solutions to correspond assignments for the undergrad-level class. Both classes’ remaining coursework and lecture notes will be organized and uploaded sooner.
These two courses mainly teach algorithms from a theoretical perspective. The topic of these courses include the time complexity analysis, dynamic programming, graph theory, (some of) approximation algorithms, and P versus NP problems.</description></item><item><title>East Asian Confucianisms: Humanism</title><link>http://ujkuo.github.io/course/confucian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ujkuo.github.io/course/confucian/</guid><description>East Asian Confucianisms: Humanism This course explores the core values and development of East Asian Confucian cultural traditions from a modern perspective and analyzes its modern implications.
