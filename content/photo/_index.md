> Here is where the madness is, for until this day no representation 
could assure me of the past of a thing except by intermediaries; 
but with the Photograph, my certainty is immediate: 
no one in the world can undeceive me. 
The Photograph then becomes a bizarre medium, a new form of hallucination: 
false on the level of perception, true on the level of time: 
a temporal hallucination, so to speak, a modest, shared hallucination 
(on the one hand "it is not there," on the other but it has indeed been") :
a mad image, chafed by reality. --- Roland Barthes, 1980, on La Chambre claire.

I have been shooting for nearly ten years. 
In the past, I also joined the media to shoot social news and sports events. 
My photography expertise and interests mainly include sports event documentaries, 
portraits of people and social documentary. 
I would like to share some past works here.
