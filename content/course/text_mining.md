## Text Mining

This course was taught by Prof. Chien-Chin Chen. 

The term project -- [Political Sentiment Analysis: 
A Survey of U.S. Media’s Attitude toward China Before and After the Presidential Election](/pdf/textmining.pdf)
(written in Chinese) -- 
aims to analyze whether media attitudes toward China differ before and after the election. 

This article combs through the US media’s reports related to China on Twitter, 
and applies BERT package to conduct sentiment analysis on the media's reports.
The results of the experimental analysis show that media reports have different attitudes towards China before and after the election,
and each media has a similar trend: after the election,
the attitude towards China is relatively flat. 
In addition, the topics related to China reported by the media before and after the election are not the same. 
For example, "Hong Kong" is a common topic of reports before the election, 
but it rarely appears in reports after the election, 
while "Taiwan" is more common after the election reports.
