## Taoism: Zhuang Zhou

This course leads students into the philosophical thought world of Zhuang Zhou and Taoism. 
Zhuang Zhou is a well-known Chinese philosopher, whose depth and breadth of thinking are highly respected by everyone. 
Taoism is the thought that I follow and admire the most, and it has greatly influenced my outlook on life. 
I was honored to be able to enter the world of Taoism and Zhuang Zhou 
under the teaching of one of my favorite college teachers - [Professor Lu Guizhen](http://www.cl.ntu.edu.tw/web/team/team_in.jsp?fp_id=FP1599316223516).

I believe that having your own thinking system is extremely important for doing research. 
A researcher is very likely to lose himself and lose confidence in the face of a highly uncertain research process 
if he does not have a firm belief. 
  Even if you are not a researcher, it is extremely important to have a way to face frustration and joy in life's ups and downs.

I share my class [note](/pdf/taoism/ZhuangNote.pdf) and [report](/pdf/taoism/ZhuangProject.pdf) (in Chinese) here.
