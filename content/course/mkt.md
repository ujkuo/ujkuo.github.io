## Game-theoretic Approach Marketing

This is a doctoral course at the Graduate School of Business. 
It mainly leads students to approach marketing from the perspective of structural models, 
and uses game theory as the main analytical tool. 
In this class, we surveyed several marketing papers, 
in which I reported the findings of  [The Beneficial Effects of Ad Blockers](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3653)
and 
[Media Platforms’ Content Provision Strategies and Sources
of Profits](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2020.1248),
and discussed with the instructor the strengths and weaknesses of the model design and the results 
in the papers. 
Such process of doing a literature review also made me deeply attracted to marketing and management research.
Additionally, I got top marks for all my assignments, term reports, and final grades in this class.

Here are my term presentation slides for both papers.
