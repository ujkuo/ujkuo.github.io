## East Asian Confucianisms: Humanism
This course explores the core values and development of 
East Asian Confucian cultural traditions from a modern perspective 
and analyzes its modern implications.
Additionally, this course examines the humanistic spirit of East Asian Confucianism, 
including the life wisdom of Confucius, Mencius, Zhuzi, Japanese and Korean Confucians, 
and the life wisdom of Taoism and Buddhism as a Confucian contrasting and interactive system.

Here is my [term project](/pdf/confucian.pdf) (written in Chinese). 
I listed the most significant core conceptions of Confucianism.
Here, I claimed that self-worth and the interactions between individuals and the entirety
are the events worthy of human beings learning no matter ancient or modern.
Moreover, I explore the possibility of the interactions between thousand-year-old Confucianism
and contemporary social values and the turbulent 21st century.
In the end, I concluded that learning Confucianism can essentially help stay in the world
within a comfortable situation
nowadays no matter of physical or psychology.

I received the highest grade both in this term project and this course.
