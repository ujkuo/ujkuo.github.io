## Algorithms

I took both undergrad- and Ph.D.-level algorithms courses at NTU. 
The attachments below are part of my solutions to correspond assignments for the undergrad-level class. 
Both classesâ€™ remaining coursework and lecture notes will be organized and uploaded sooner.

These two courses mainly teach algorithms from a theoretical perspective.
The topic of these courses include the time complexity analysis, dynamic programming, graph theory,
(some of) approximation algorithms,
and P versus NP problems.
In these algorithm courses, I learned the most about algorithmic thing,
the logic and correctness verification of algorithm, 
the optimization analysis of algorithm, and how to design algorithms.
