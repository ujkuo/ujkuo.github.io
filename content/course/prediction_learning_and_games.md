## Prediction, Learning, and Games
##### Online Machine Learning 

This course was taught by Prof. [Yen-Huan Li ](https://sites.google.com/site/yenhuanli/home).
The course studies the online learning problem and its extensions from several aspects. 
The topics include Blackwell approachability, PAC-Bayes analysis, probability forecasting with the logarithmic loss, 
online portfolio selection, and learning with expert advice. (from course website)

The course's three assignments and the final project all include extensive literature reviews. 
For [hw0](/pdf/plg/hw0.pdf), 
we first did a preliminary literature review in this field to understand the topics that are currently 
being studied in online machine learning. 
[hw1](/pdf/plg/hw1.pdf) mainly focuses on Blackwell approach and calibration problems, 
in order to understand how Blackwell understood and solved the prediction problem without any statistical assumptions. 
In [hw2](/pdf/plg/hw2.pdf), we analyze the performance guarantees of different regrets to capture model dynamics.

In the [term project](/pdf/plg/final.pdf), 
we studied how to solve the non-convex problem under the framework of online learning. 
This type of problem usually introduces the oracle model in the optimization theory, 
and uses this as a basis to improve the performance of the algorithm. 
In addition, we also understand the relationship between online learning and statistical learning through literature review, 
and how to leverage each other's strengths.

The biggest gain and extended thinking of this course is how to apply this type of knowledge to economic problems. 
Issues such as non-parametric bayesian, model averaging, model selection, etc. are often mentioned in the class, 
and econometrics also often discusses such issues. 
I look forward to becoming more familiar with the literature and technology in this area in the future.
