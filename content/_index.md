I am Yu-Chieh Kuo, a photojournalist, a documentary and portrait photographer,
and currently I am also an undergrad student double major in the department of
Information Management and the department of Mathematics at National Taiwan University, NTU.
I am interested in the field regarding the combination of technology and social science for social good, 
including Data Science, Economics, Information Management/Science and Social Computing, etc.
I am going forward to take advanced courses and do rigorous research based on my research interest.
Also, I will try to apply MS/MA and Ph.D. degree on those fields on fall, 2023 or later.</p>
