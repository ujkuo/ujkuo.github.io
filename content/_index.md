<!-- I am a senior undergraduate at the [Department of Information Management](https://management.ntu.edu.tw/en/IM),
[National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).

> I am a research professional at Chicago Booth.

My current research focuses on banking, regulation, and the influence of mobility on financial behaviors.
I work extensively with consumer credit data from the [TransUnion dataset](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/research-data/transunion) and employ Large Language Models (LLMs).
I am also keenly interested in understanding the role of information across various contexts.
Take information disclosure in the financial sector as an example:
How do different modes of information disclosure shape corporate economic behaviors and outcomes,
how do companies strategize information disclosure to attract attention and investment,
and do peer effects and spillover effects exist in these disclosure practices?
Similarly, in advertising,
I am interested in exploring the role of marketing and financial behaviors, the effective advertising strategies, the factors that make advertisements go viral, and the optimal methods for advertisement pre-launch evaluation.
Drawing on my diverse background and interdisciplinary training, I integrate tools from economics, statistics, and computer science to address these questions.

Luxury brands, the fashion industry, and membership-based business models also frequently capture my attention. As a devotee of brands, fashion, and hospitality—particularly hotels—I’m fascinated by the opportunity to study company strategies both from the perspective of a scholar (or econometrician) and a practitioner. One day, I hope to provide valuable, data-driven strategic insights to these brands. I am also interested in understanding whether firms truly behave as scholars predict.

Luxury brands, the fashion industry, and the membership system are also parts of my daily musing. 
As a fan of brands, fashion, and hotels, 
it's fascinating for me to learn about the company's strategy from the perspective of a scholar (or an econometrician, lol) 
and a practitioner.
It would be more than great to be able to provide brands with valuable strategic advice one day.
I am also interested in understanding if firms act in the way the scholars explain and explain.

Besides business research, I am also drawn to Eastern Philosophy, literature, and movies. 
During my undergraduate, I pursued a double major in Chinese Literature (despite incomplete) with a focus on Taoist philosophy and modern Taiwanese literature.
Taoist Philosophy carves and embodies my life vision, and Taiwanese literature and movies consolidate my national identity.

Outside of academia, I engage in photography and mentor high school students in academic preparation and school applications.
With 8+ year of expertise in photography, I have been a documentary and sports photographer/photojournalist for several media outlets.
I have also served as a tutor and a mentor for 40+ high school students and families for 5+ years.
