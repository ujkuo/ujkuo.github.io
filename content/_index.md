> ***I will join ChicagoBooth as a Research Professional this summer!***

I enjoy exploring the diversity of society and sharing knowledge.
My research interests concentrate on intersection between Economics, Business, and Computer Science.
I possess a deep interest and curiosity in various business research fields, including branding strategies, advertisement, digital economy, accounting, etc.
Besides, I am also intrigued by social network and learning problems in Econ/CS.

Outside academia, I have been a 
documentary and sports photographer/photojournalist for over 7 years, 
cat lover, tea addict, $\LaTeX$ lover and promoter.
I have also served as a mentor and a consultant for 40+ high school students and families on the family relationship,
study plans, and application strategies for over five years.
