I am a junior student double major in the Department of Information Management 
and the Department of Mathematics at National Taiwan University, NTU.
I am interested in the field regarding the combination of technology and social science for social good, 
including Data Science, Economics, Information Management/Science and Social Computing, etc.
Currently I am working with [Prof. Lin-Shan Lee](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901017)
