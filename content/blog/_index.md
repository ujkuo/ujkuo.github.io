title = "Writing, Learning, and Observations"

I would love to share some editorials, reports, information sharing, and life observations I have written on this page. 
Articles are written in either Chinese or English, but sometimes I translate them in both languages. 
I will mark whether the article is written in Chinese [C] or English [E] in the title of the article.
