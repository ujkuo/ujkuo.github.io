#### Decision Making (Invited Talk to Junior High School Students)

I was invited to give a speech to junior high school students as an honorary alumnus. 
The topic of the whole speech revolves around my philosophy of life and the process of thinking and decision-making. 
Especially after I chose to enter the field of economics, 
I have the ability to express the questions that I have been thinking about 
since I was in the seventh to ninth grades in a more rigorous way, 
and I am also able to convey these academic language to the students sitting in the audience 
through examples suitable for the audience (thanks to my teachers for their excellent guidance and teaching).

This is not the first time I have given a speech to junior high school students. 
In fact, I have been invited many times to speak to high school students.
I am passionate about educational issues and passing on my ideas to others, 
and I also believe that passing on high-level knowledge and thought processes to young students 
enables them to think and explore their lives and the world from a young age. 
Taiwanese education system does not give students enough time to think about life and explore the world; 
on the contrary, schools require students to spend too much time learning rigid knowledge. 
Under such an atmosphere and pressure, 
students do not have many incentives to think about "not-in-the-examination" questions, 
which I think is quite a pity and incorrect. 
So every time I have the opportunity to talk to young students, 
I hope that I can arouse their interest in thinking about higher-level issues, 
instead of confining life to exams and schools.

Although the [presentation slide](https://hackmd.io/@ujkuo/Bkt3NVkps) is in Chinese, 
I believe that Google Translate can convey the ideas in the presentation excellently.
