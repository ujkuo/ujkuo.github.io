## About Me

I am Yu-Chieh Kuo, a student double major in the Department of Information Management and the 
Department of Mathematics at National Taiwan University, NTU.
Before I entered into NTU, I studied at Taipei Municipal ChienKuo High School, Taipei, Taiwan.

Currently I'm a college student, a part-time home tutor teaching many students, a project manager and a photographer.

## Interest

I have several interests, such as enjoying cuisines, reading, especially photography. 

I am a photojournalist, a documentary and portrait photographer, and I had been working for several
media such as [The Reporter](https://www.twreporter.org), [Running Biji](https://running.biji.co)  and [CKPC](https://www.facebook.com/CKPC.tw).
I pay a lot of attention to Taiwan social change issues and try to record them in the form of image, aiming to leave a record for contemporary Taiwan society for people caring about Taiwan
to see the change in every period.

I am also a home tutor/mentor for several elementary/junior high/senior high school students.
It's common for college students to work as a home tutor, and so do I. I put lots of effort
on teaching my student not only about courses knowledge, but also about their life, their attitude and other important things. Due to my effort, many students went to their dream school and
got good grades.

## Academic

My research interest concentrates on the field regarding the combination of technology and social science for social good, 
including Data Science, Economics, Information Management/Science and Social Computing, etc.
To improve my ability to do academic researchs, I am taking advanced courses such as Mathematics Analysic, Linear Algebra, 
Data Visualization, Microeconomics Theory and other graduate level courses. Selected courses are listed in my resume. **If you are interested in taking courses together, please contact me then we can
have a study group.**
